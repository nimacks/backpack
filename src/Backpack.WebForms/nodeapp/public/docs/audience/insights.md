## Subscriber Insights

Subscriber Insights is your subscribers dashboard. Gain insights you can use to build, retain, and target your subscribers. We'll be adding more charts and actions over time. Let us know what you'd like to see.

**Active Subscribers**

Addresses that you have sent a campaign to in the last 90 days.

**List Growth and Churn Over Time**

List Growth shows how your active subscriber count is built over time, via WordFly Signup, WordFly Lightbox, and Imports. List Churn shows how your count is reduced over time due to Hard Bounce Removals, Opt-Outs, and Abuse Complaints. Click the chart to enable interactivity and use mouse or trackpad to adjust time ranges.
